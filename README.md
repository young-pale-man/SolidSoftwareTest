# Solid SoftWare test project🧑‍💻

Flutter application written according to the recruiter’s technical specifications for 
Solid Software recruitment purposes

## Technologies🔧

#### - Flutter
#### - StatefulWidgets
#### - OOP
#### - Solid Lints

## Interface💻

The application screen at launch is a black background with white text "Hello there" in the very center of the screen.

## Functionality🕹

When you single-click on any part of the screen, the background changes its color to a randomly generated one. 
This part of the functionality was described in the technical specifications.

I also added functionality:
1) Change text color when you click on it once
2) Return the background color to the original (black) by long pressing on any part of the screen
3) Return the background color to the original (white) by long pressing on the text

## Tests✅

The application has been tested for problems and errors by using the Solid Lints extension. The "dart analyze" and 
"dart run custom_lint" commands identified errors in the lack of public members documentation. Subsequently, all 
problems were corrected.
